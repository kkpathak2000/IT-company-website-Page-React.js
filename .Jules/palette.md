## 2025-05-15 - [Focus Visibility and Form Loading UX]
**Learning:** In Bootstrap 5/React 19 environments, default browser focus outlines are often suppressed or insufficient. Applying a custom `:focus-visible` style using a theme-consistent `box-shadow` or high-contrast `outline` significantly improves keyboard navigation accessibility without compromising aesthetic for mouse users. Additionally, providing immediate visual feedback (loading spinner + "Sending..." text) and disabling the submit button during async form submission prevents user frustration and accidental double-posts.
**Action:** Always verify focus visibility for interactive elements (links, buttons) using keyboard navigation (Tab) and ensure all async actions have distinct loading/disabled states.
